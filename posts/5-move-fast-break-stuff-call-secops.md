title: 'Move Fast, Break Stuff, Call Infosec'

Development has lived by the mantra "move fast and break things" for years now the things breaking are cloud configurations, access controls and entire security measures with the rise of AI and "vibe coding". Vibe coding is great until someone accidentally ships your database to a public S3 bucket on the internet because they asked their agent to "make my database more structured and reusable". Developers are moving faster with AI agents and cloud providers that let you stand up infrastructure with just a few clicks. Security debt is slowly piling up.

## We can't vibe code our way out of this

The problem is that we can't vibe code our way out of this. We need to slow down and think about the security implications of what we're doing. AI driven development has taken productivity to new levels and I'm not sure we can put the genie back in the bottle. We need to find a way to balance the speed of development with the security of our systems.

## Infosec will be the new AI Boom

If you look at any job posting they are AI this and that and has been for quite some time now. I suspect as we start seeing some of the implications of vibe coding and AI driven development we will see a sharp shift in the job market towards Infosec.

The talent gap appears to be growing and the demand for security professionals is only going to increase. I can list of 100 developers that I know but only a few that work in Infosec.
