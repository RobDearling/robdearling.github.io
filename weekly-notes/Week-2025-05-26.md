## What I read this week

- [Comparing Makefile and Just](https://glinteco.com/en/post/comparing-makefile-and-just-which-one-should-you-choose/)

## What I did this week

- Attempted to move my DNS management from Cloudflare to Azure which failed due to Cloudflares lock in for nameserver management
- Wrote a blog talking about the vendor lock you get when you register your domain through Cloudflare
- Started work on a custom Sharex uploader API in Go that uses Azure storage apps as a backend
- Looked into [Just](https://github.com/casey/just) which seems like a modern alternative to Makefiles.
- Implemented an RSS feed for this website
- Added a page for displaying the feeds I'm currently following
- Managed to get RetroArch running successfully on the Fire TV stick and jailbroken Nintendo Switch
