## What I've been up to

- I've been playing with my new Raspberry Pi 5. So far I've setup RetroPie, NextCloud, Glance dashboard and FreshRSS. I'm currently in the process of writing the Ansible roles so I can reconfigure it quickly when needed.
- I picked up [ctrl+alt+chaos](https://www.hardmanswainson.com/books/ctrlaltchaos/) after listening to a podcast episode on Darknet diaries
- I've been playing with Go some more, its nice to have a single language that can either be a full binary or be run as a quick one-off script.
