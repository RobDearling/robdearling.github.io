## Sites & Articles that interested me

- [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) interested me this week. I've been following a feat/fix/chore prefix for a little while now, its interesting to see a specification that may lead to some standardisation.
- [Commitizen](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/) Is a CLI based tool that assists you with versioning and commit writing.
- [Kirby CMS](https://getkirby.com/) Looks extremely interesting. The entire CMS is file based so you're not locked into a Vendors modelling of your data but the price is just too high for something I'm doing as a hobby.
- I read Murat Buffalos post titled [Advice to the young](https://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2024/07/advice-to-young.html?ref=dailydev) again.

## What I did this week

- Actually blogged for the first time 🎉
- I bought a server from [RackNerd](https://www.racknerd.com/) they had a crazy black Friday deal where I managed to snap up a 2.5GB, 2 Core KVM VPS for year for the price of £15 🫨. I've not decided what I'm going to host there at the moment...
