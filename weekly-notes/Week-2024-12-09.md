## Sites & Articles that interested me

- [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) interested me this week. I've been following a feat/fix/chore prefix for a little while now, its interesting to see a specification that may lead to some standardisation.
- [Commitizen](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/) Is a CLI based tool that assists you with versioning and commit writing.
- [Kirby CMS](https://getkirby.com/) Looks extremely interesting. The entire CMS is file based so you're not locked into a Vendors modelling of your data but the price is just too high for something I'm doing as a hobby.
- I read Murat Buffalos post titled [Advice to the young](https://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2024/07/advice-to-young.html?ref=dailydev) again.
- Microsoft released a [Local Emulator for Azure Service Bus](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/messagingonazureblog/introducing-local-emulator-for-azure-service-bus/4304457) which is awesome.
- Explored [Microplane](https://github.com/clever/microplane?tab=readme-ov-file) which seems like a cool project to automate mass updating Git repos. I started building something similar in .NET a while back so I'm interested to see how this works out.
- Finally tried out Cursor after a few recommendations. So far it is better/more convenient than standard co-pilot but I'm unsure if it warrants $20/mo better. I plan on trying it out some more however.

## What I did this week

- Actually blogged for the first time ðŸŽ‰
- I bought a server from [RackNerd](https://www.racknerd.com/) they had a good black Friday deal where I managed to snap up a 2.5GB, 2 Core KVM VPS for year for the price of Â£15 ðŸ«¨. I've not decided what I'm going to host there at the moment...
- Read into what options Azure has in terms of hosting SQL databases
- Created a Christmas trivia page for a bit of fun at the end of standups.
