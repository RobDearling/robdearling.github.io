## What I've been up to

- Continuing to read Ctrl + Alt + Chaos
- We got our smart meter installed which sparked a new idea
- Started building a new Go package named [Octogo](https://github.com/RobDearling/Octogo) which interfaces with the Octopus Energy REST API.
- Exploring how I can automate my home using home assistant and the Octopus Energy API to figure out when the rates are at their lowest
- The Kotlin team have released a [Kotlin LSP for VSCode](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-lsp) I've been trying it out since I'm trying to consolidate on a single editor. It seems promising but lacks a lot of features that allows me to do all Kotlin development in VSCode.
